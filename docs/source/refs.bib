  abstract = {Many authors have focused on the contribution of inner farm nutrient recycling to closed nutrient cycles, but little is known about the contribution of exchanges among farms to nutrient cycling. By using a network approach, we assessed the structure of farm mass flows networks and their consequences for nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) recycling in organic farming at the local scale. Organic farming was considered as a prototype of farming systems that aims at better closing nutrient cycles. Inflows and outflows were collected for two cropping years on 63 organic farms. The farms were located in three French agricultural districts with areas ranging from 520 to 1021 km2 and differentiated by their degree of specialization (specialized in crop production, animal production, or mixed). Local nutrient recycling was assessed at the district scale through: (i) the local supply, defined as the ratio of the amount of nutrients from exchanges among farms plus the amount of nitrogen from atmospheric sources, to the sum of inputs to organic farms; and (ii) the cycling index, defined as the fraction of nutrients flowing at least twice through the same farms. Results showed that exchanges among farms were mainly shortdistance exchanges ({$<$}50 km on average) and contributed up to 70\% of farm nutrient inflow. Mass flows among farms were two to four times greater in the mixed district than in specialized districts. As a consequence, both the local supply and the cycling index were greater in the mixed district than in the specialized districts. However, even if the local supply was generally high (85\%, 52\% and 54\% for N, P and K inflows in the mixed district, respectively), the cycling index remained low (5\%, 20\% and 10\% for N, P and K in the mixed district), indicating that most flows among farms were one-way and not actual nutrient recycling. This study contributes to the understanding of the magnitude, conditions and factors of nutrient recycling in agriculture at the local scale.},

To reach that goal we extended the Generalized Representation of Agro-Food System approach to P and C and applied it to French regions. Using this methodology we analyzed the relation between production pattern and N surplus, P budget, and efficient organic carbon inputs (OCeff), assuming these three indicators to be good proxies for (i) N losses to waterbodies and the atmosphere, (ii) P accumulation or depletion in soils, and (iii) potential additional C sequestration in soils, respectively.},

  abstract = {Importance of agricultural transport in the biogeochemical cycle of nitrogen in France: insight into territorial production specialization. The French agriculture, agronomically and economically very efficient, is responsible for significant nitrogen losses to the hydrosystems and the atmosphere, causing severe environmental damages. Based on the analysis of the SitraM database on commodity transport between French administrative departments and with foreign countries, a budget of agricultural goods has been established, in terms of imbedded protein-N fluxes, for seven groups of agricultural commodities. The 95 French departments were grouped into 33 agricultural territories defined according to their geographical proximity and the similarity of their production system. The results show the magnitude of commercial mobility of agricultural goods. Trade exchanges between territories and with foreign countries in 2006 amount to 1.6 fold the national production. Overall, France appears as net exporter of proteins with foreign countries, importing 284 ktonN/yr of feed and exporting 390 ktonN/yr mostly as cereals. The analysis reveals the extreme specialisation of many territories into either cash crop or livestock farming, and allows distinguishing five major territorial ensembles on the basis of the magnitude and destination of their food and feed exchanges. Controlling the nitrogen cycle and its perturbations by agriculture requires taking into account trade fluxes of agricultural commodities.},

  author = {Anglade, Juliette and Billen, Gilles and Garnier, Josette},
  abstract = {Management of nitrogen (N) inputs into agricultural systems is of increasing interest due to the intensive use of synthetic fertilizers in modern cash crop systems, which has caused considerable environmental damage, including nitrate contamination of surface and groundwater, eutrophication of coastal marine areas and emission of greenhouse gases. The use of legumes grown in rotations or intercropping is nowadays regarded as an alternative and sustainable way of introducing N into low-input cropping systems. In order to develop a simple tool to assess biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) by legume pulse and forages within crop rotations, we conducted a systematic literature survey with a quantitative statistical analysis intended to define a robust relationship between measurable variables and N2 fixation. We found highly significant correlations between total N accumulation in shoot matter and fixed N2 in forage (y ¼ 0.79x 0.49) and grain (y ¼ 0.70x þ 1.01) legumes. Accurately estimating the contribution of belowground components is more difficult because of a lack of relevant studies. Properly assessing BNF is crucial to evaluate the possibility of diversified legume based cropping systems achieving a balance between inputs and outputs, thus ensuring both short-term productivity and long-term sustainability. For a typical nine-year organic rotation in the Paris basin alternating legumes and cereals, the soil surface balance, calculated with the relationships obtained, indicated that N fluxes were balanced, leaving a surplus of only a few kg N/ha/yr, with legumes accounting for 86\% of total N inputs.},

  abstract = {Nitrogen (N) is essential for plant growth and protein synthesis but global reactive N losses, mainly from food systems, induce strong environmental impacts. N losses after human excretion are often overlooked because, in Western societies, they partly occur as inert N2, following denitrification in wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), and losses in waters are often small compared to diffuse agricultural emissions. Yet N from human excretions could be used for crop fertilization, potentially with very high recycling rates via source separation. In this study we use unique operational data from the ∼20,000 French WWTPs to produce a N mass-balance of excretions in the French sanitation system. Even though 75\% of WWTPs’ sludge is spread on crops, only 10\% of the excreted N is recycled and 50\% of N is lost to the atmosphere, mainly through WWTP nitrificationdenitrification. The remaining 40\% ends up in water or in diffuse losses in the ground, of which about half is lost outside of the WWTPs’ discharge system, through sewers storm water and individual autonomous systems. While WWTPs removal efficiency increased in the 2000s, it has been followed by a decade of stagnation, reaching 70\% at the national level. This national average hides regional discrepancies, from 60 to 85\% in the 6 French water agencies basins. These differences closely correlate with the classification as “N sensitive areas” and is mainly due to large WWTPs which handle most of the N load. Recycling all N in excretions could supply 10\% of domestic protein consumption in the current French food system, and up to 30\% if it is prioritized towards crop production for human consumption. Redesigning the food system (decrease of nutrient losses, more plant-based diets) could further increase this contribution.},
