# Terminology and Units

## Units
- All flows are expressed in **ktN / yr** (kilo ton of Nitrogen per year) unless stated otherwise. ktN refer to the amount of pure Nitrogen. For example, a flow of 1 ktN/yr of ammonia (NH3) correspond to a real flow of 17/14 ktNH3/yr.

## Compartments

GRAFS-E describe the flows between compartments. These compartment belongs to differents type : crops, livestock, product, population, trade, environment, industry. Here is the complete list of compartments :
