# Output

The output data is organized into a transition matrix showing the flows between each compartment, along with 7 dataframes presenting the input data, intermediate calculations, and output data:

- **df_cultures**: related to crops
- **df_elevage**: related to livestock
- **df_pop**: related to populations
- **df_prod**: related to products
- **df_global**: provides the global input data.
- **allocations_df**: shows the output of the allocation model between products and consumers (humans and animals)
- **deviations_df**: shows the deviations between the allocation model output and the target (Diet tab from the data Excel sheet)

**df_cultures**, **df_elevage**, **df_pop**, **df_prod**, and **df_global** contain both outputs and input data. **df_global** simply records the global variables provided as input.

## Transition Matrix

The most comprehensive output from the model is a transition matrix. This square matrix shows the flows between each compartment. It has the same size as the number of compartments. Each coefficient \(c_{ij}\) represents the nitrogen flow in ktN from compartment i to compartment j. The sum of column j gives all the inputs of a compartment, while the sum of row i gives all the outputs of a compartment.

For all compartments in the following sets:
- **crops**
- **livestock**
- **products**
- **population**

The sum of the inputs equals the sum of the outputs. These compartments are considered **internal**, and they are balanced.

- **Type**: Animal or human
- **Expected Proportion (%)**: Proportion defined in the ideal diet
- **Deviation (%)**: Deviation between the target allocation and the allocation proposed by the optimization model (0% if the model perfectly respects the ideal diet)
